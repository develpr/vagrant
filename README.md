Apache Vagrant Box
==========

Ubuntu 14.04


To use:

1. Download Vagrant [vagrantup.com](http://www.vagrantup.com) - known to be working with 1.4, 1.5, 1.6.
1. Install the vagrant host manager plugin `vagrant plugin install vagrant-hostmanager`
1. run `vagrant up` in terminal


By default, vagrant will setup [site.dev](http://site.dev), but this can be changed/configured by editing the project_name in the Vagrantfile.
